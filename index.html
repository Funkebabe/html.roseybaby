   <div> <h1>Design</h1>
    <p>I'm probably not the typical designer positioned behind an Illustrator artboard adjusting pixels, but I design. Immersed in stylesheets tweaking font sizes and contemplating layouts is where you'll find me (~_^). I'm committed to creating fluent user experiences while staying fashionable.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Engineering</h1>
    <p>In building JavaScript applications, I'm equipped with just the right tools, and can absolutely function independently of them to deliver fast, resilient solutions optimized for scale â€” performance and scalabilty are priorities on my radar.</p>

<div class="div4">
    <h1 class="hi">Over the years,</h1>
    <p class="hh">I've built products for companies and businesses around the globe ranging from marketing websites to complex solutions and enterprise apps with focus on fast, elegant and accessible user experiences.</p>
<p class="hh">Currently, I work at Shopify as a Senior Frontend Engineer crafting thoughtful and inclusive experiences that adhere to web standards for over 3 million merchants across the world.</p>
<p class="hh">Before now, I was Principal Frontend Engineer at hellotax, where I worked on a suite of tools and services tailored towards automated VAT compliance for multi-channel sellers in Europe.
</p>
<p class="hh">Prior to hellotax, I was Senior frontend engineering consultant with Pixel2HTML, building JavaScript applications and interfaces for orgs and individuals.</p>
<pc class="hh">I once also led the frontend team at Conectar, an e-learning startup through building multiple React applications into a single robust learning platform.
